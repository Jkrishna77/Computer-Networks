# üåê Computer Networks

## 1. Introduction to Computer Networks

A **computer network** is a system of interconnected devices (computers, servers, routers, switches, mobile devices, IoT sensors, etc.) that can exchange data and share resources with each other.  
In today‚Äôs IT world, networks form the backbone of almost everything we do ‚Äî from browsing websites, deploying applications in the cloud, video conferencing, to managing distributed systems in DevOps.

---

### üîë Why Networks Matter in IT?
- **Collaboration:** Teams across the globe can work together in real-time (e.g., Google Docs, Slack).  
- **Cloud Computing:** AWS, Azure, and GCP rely entirely on networking to connect data centers and customers.  
- **Microservices & DevOps:** Modern applications are broken into multiple services (APIs, databases, caching layers) that communicate over the network.  
- **Remote Work:** VPNs, SSH, and secure protocols allow engineers to manage servers from anywhere.  

Without networks, there would be no **Internet**, no **email**, no **websites**, no **DevOps pipelines**, and no **distributed systems**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Real-World Example: Opening `https://github.com`
When you type `https://github.com` in your browser:
1. **DNS Resolution:** The domain name `github.com` is translated into an IP address.  
2. **TCP Connection:** Your browser establishes a **TCP connection** with GitHub‚Äôs server over port `443` (HTTPS).  
3. **TLS Handshake:** A secure encrypted channel is set up using TLS.  
4. **HTTP Request:** Your browser sends an HTTP `GET` request asking for the GitHub homepage.  
5. **Server Response:** GitHub‚Äôs servers respond with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.  
6. **Rendering:** Your browser renders the page and shows the GitHub homepage.  

All of this happens in **milliseconds**, powered by computer networks.

---

### üß© Key Takeaways
- A network connects devices so they can **communicate** and **share resources**.  
- Networking is essential for **software engineers, DevOps engineers, and cloud architects**.  
- Even simple actions like opening a website involve **multiple networking steps and protocols**.  

---

## 2. History & Evolution of Networks

Computer networking has evolved rapidly over the past few decades. Let‚Äôs focus on the **key changes that shaped today‚Äôs Internet**:

---

### üì° Early Days
- **1960s‚Äì70s:** ARPANET connected a few universities ‚Äî the first step towards the Internet.  
- Networks were limited, used mainly for research and text-based communication.  

---

### üíª Client-Server Era
- **1980s‚Äì90s:** Rise of **client-server model** ‚Äî PCs connected to central servers for email, file sharing, and applications.  
- Protocols like **SMTP (email), FTP (file transfer), HTTP (web)** became popular.  
- Businesses began deploying **LANs (Local Area Networks)** in offices.  

---

### üåç Birth of the Internet
- **1990s:** Networks worldwide connected, forming the **Internet**.  
- Websites, web browsers, and ISPs became mainstream.  
- **Optical fiber cables** and undersea cables started forming the global backbone.  

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Modern Networking
- **2000s‚ÄìPresent:**  
  - **Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, GCP):** On-demand servers and services accessible via the Internet.  
  - **Mobile & Wireless:** WiFi, 4G/5G networks enable always-on connectivity.  
  - **DevOps & Microservices:** Applications are distributed across multiple services communicating over APIs.  
  - **Virtual Networks:** VPNs, SDN (Software Defined Networking), and container networking (Kubernetes CNIs).  

---

### üß© Key Takeaways
- Networking moved from **research ‚Üí business ‚Üí Internet ‚Üí cloud-native world**.  
- Today, almost all modern IT infrastructure ‚Äî from Kubernetes clusters to CI/CD pipelines ‚Äî relies on computer networks.  

---

## 3. Networking Architectures

The way devices communicate in a network can be organized into different **architectures**. The two most common are **Client-Server** and **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Client-Server Architecture
In this model, one system acts as the **server** (provides services or resources), and the other systems act as **clients** (request services).

- **How it works:**
  1. The client sends a request (e.g., ‚Äúgive me the homepage‚Äù).
  2. The server processes the request.
  3. The server sends a response back to the client.

- **Real-world IT examples:**
  - **Web Applications:** Your browser (client) requests data from a web server (GitHub, Gmail, Netflix).  
  - **Databases:** An application connects to a database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL) to fetch records.   

- **Advantages:**
  - Centralized control and management.
  - Easier to secure and monitor.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Server can become a bottleneck.
  - If server fails ‚Üí service downtime.

---

### ü§ù Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
In this model, **each device (peer)** can act as both **client and server**. There‚Äôs no single point of control.

- **How it works:**
  - Devices connect directly and share resources with each other.

- **Real-world IT examples:**
  - **BitTorrent:** Peers share pieces of a file with each other.  
  - **Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies:** Every node maintains a copy of the ledger and validates transactions.  
  - **Collaboration Tools:** Some messaging apps (early Skype versions) used P2P for direct communication.  

- **Advantages:**
  - Highly scalable (no central server dependency).
  - Resource sharing is distributed.  
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Harder to secure and manage.
  - Performance depends on peers‚Äô availability.  

---

### üß© Key Takeaways
- **Client-Server**: Centralized, reliable, but server can be a bottleneck.  
- **P2P**: Decentralized, scalable, but harder to control.  
- Modern systems often use a **hybrid approach** (e.g., P2P for file distribution + central servers for authentication).  

---

## 4. Protocols & Standards

A **protocol** is a set of rules that define how data is transmitted and received over a network.  
Without protocols, devices from different vendors would not be able to communicate reliably.

---

### üìú Why Standards Matter
- Networking involves millions of devices across the globe ‚Äî from laptops and smartphones to routers and cloud servers.  
- **Standards** ensure that all these devices can talk to each other, regardless of manufacturer.  
- Example: A Windows laptop can connect to a Linux server using SSH because both follow the **SSH protocol standard**.  

---

### üîë Common Networking Protocols
Here are the most widely used protocols in modern IT environments:

| Layer (TCP/IP) | Protocol | Purpose | Real-World Example |
|----------------|----------|---------|--------------------|
| Application | **HTTP/HTTPS** | Web communication | Browsing `https://github.com` |
| Application | **DNS** | Converts domain names ‚Üí IP addresses | Resolving `github.com` to `140.82.xx.xx` |
| Application | **SMTP, IMAP, POP3** | Email transmission & retrieval | Sending email via Gmail/Outlook |
| Application | **FTP/SFTP** | File transfer | Uploading files to a server |
| Application | **SSH** | Secure remote login | Connecting to a Linux VM in AWS |
| Transport | **TCP** | Reliable communication | Git clone over HTTPS |
| Transport | **UDP** | Low-latency communication | Online gaming, video streaming |
| Internet | **IP (IPv4/IPv6)** | Logical addressing & routing | Sending packets across the Internet |
| Internet | **ICMP** | Error reporting, diagnostics | `ping google.com` |
| Network Access | **Ethernet, WiFi** | Physical + Data Link transmission | Office LAN, home WiFi |

---

### üåç Real-World Example
When you run:

```bash
curl https://example.com
````

This is what happens under the hood:

1. **DNS**: Your system resolves `example.com` into an IP address.
2. **TCP**: A TCP connection is established on port `443`.
3. **TLS (HTTPS)**: Encryption is negotiated for secure transfer.
4. **HTTP**: A GET request is sent for the `/` resource.
5. **Server Response**: The server replies with an HTML page.

This single command uses **multiple protocols** working together in layers.

---

### üß© Key Takeaways

* Protocols = **rules for communication**.
* Standards allow **interoperability** across devices, OSes, and vendors.
* Every time you open a website, check email, or SSH into a server, multiple protocols are working behind the scenes.

---

## 5. Data Transmission Basics

At the core of networking is the process of **sending and receiving data**.  
But computers do not send entire files or web pages in one go ‚Äî instead, data is broken into **small packets**, which are then transmitted across the network.

---

### üì¶ What is a Packet?
- A **packet** is the basic unit of data transmitted over a network.  
- Each packet contains:
  - **Header** ‚Üí Control information (source/destination IP, port, protocol type, sequence numbers).  
  - **Payload** ‚Üí The actual data being carried (HTML content, JSON response, etc.).  
  - **Trailer** ‚Üí Error-checking information (in some layers).  

---

### üîÑ Encapsulation & Decapsulation
When data is sent from one computer to another, it passes through multiple layers of the networking stack.  
Each layer **adds its own header** (encapsulation).  
At the receiving end, each layer **removes its header** (decapsulation).

#### Flow Example: Sending an HTTP request
1. **Application Layer (HTTP):**  
   - Data = `GET / HTTP/1.1` request.  
2. **Transport Layer (TCP):**  
   - Adds TCP header (source port, destination port, sequence number).  
3. **Internet Layer (IP):**  
   - Adds IP header (source IP, destination IP).  
4. **Data Link Layer (Ethernet/WiFi):**  
   - Adds MAC addresses of source and destination devices.  
5. **Physical Layer:**  
   - Converts the data into electrical signals, light pulses, or radio waves.  

On the receiving side (the server), the reverse process happens (decapsulation).  

---

### üåç Real-World Example: Accessing `https://example.com`
1. You type `https://example.com` in your browser.  
2. The browser generates an **HTTP request**.  
3. The request is encapsulated with TCP, IP, and Ethernet headers.  
4. The data travels from:
   - **Your laptop ‚Üí WiFi router ‚Üí ISP ‚Üí Internet backbone ‚Üí Server**.  
5. At each hop, devices like **routers** examine the IP header to decide the next path.  
6. At the destination, the server decapsulates the packet, processes the HTTP request, and sends back a response.  

---

### üìä Packet Fragmentation
- Networks have size limits called **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)**.  
- If a packet is too large, it is **fragmented** into smaller packets.  
- Example: Uploading a 10 MB file ‚Üí broken into thousands of smaller packets.  

---

### üß© Key Takeaways
- Data is always transmitted in **packets**, not as a whole file at once.  
- **Encapsulation** wraps data with headers at each layer, and **decapsulation** unwraps them.  
- Tools like **Wireshark** let engineers capture and analyze packets in real-time.  

---

## 6. IP Addressing

Every device in a network needs a unique identifier to communicate.  
That identifier is the **IP address (Internet Protocol address)**.

---

### üìç What is an IP Address?
- An **IP address** is a logical numeric address assigned to each device on a network.  
- It identifies both:
  - **Source** (where the packet came from).  
  - **Destination** (where the packet is going).  

Example:
- When you call your friend, from contacts you will be calling to his name but in back ground its dailing to his unique mobile number.  
- When you ping Google (`ping google.com`), your packet might be routed to an IP like `142.250.77.78` (Google has many servers in your case it might be differ).

---

### üåê IPv4
- **32-bit address** (4 octets, written in decimal).  
- Example: `192.168.1.10`  
- Total: ~4.3 billion possible addresses.  
- Problem: With billions of devices (IoT, cloud, mobile), IPv4 is not enough.  

---

### üåç IPv6
- **128-bit address** (written in hexadecimal).  
- Example: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`  
- Virtually unlimited addresses (~340 undecillion).  
- Designed to replace IPv4, but both are used today (dual stack).  

---

### üè† Public vs Private IPs
- **Public IP:** Globally routable on the Internet (e.g., a cloud VM‚Äôs IP).  
- **Private IP:** Used within local networks, not accessible directly from Internet.   

**Real-world example:**  
- In AWS, a **VPC subnet** may use private IPs (`10.x.x.x`).  
- To access the Internet, instances go through a **NAT Gateway** with a public IP.  

---

### üñß Static vs Dynamic IPs
- **Static IP:** Manually assigned, does not change. (e.g., database server).  
- **Dynamic IP:** Assigned automatically by **DHCP**. (e.g., laptops on office WiFi).  

---

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Subnetting & CIDR
- Networks can be split into **subnets** for efficiency and security.  
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** notation defines how many bits are used for network vs host.  
  - Example: `192.168.1.0/24` ‚Üí 256 IPs (from `.0` to `.255`).  

**Real-world example:**  
- A Kubernetes cluster might use `10.244.0.0/16` CIDR for pod networking.  
- Each node/pod gets an IP from that range.  

---

### üß™ Practical Commands
- **Check your IP:**  
  ```bash
  ip addr show   # Linux
  ipconfig       # Windows
  ```

- **Test connectivity (ping):**
```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```

- **Trace packet path:**
```bash
traceroute google.com   # Linux
tracert google.com      # Windows
```
### üß© Key Takeaways

- IP address = unique logical identifier of a device.
- IPv4 is running out ‚Üí IPv6 is the future.
- Public IP = Internet-facing, Private IP = internal use.
- Subnetting & CIDR are crucial for cloud and DevOps networking.

## 7. Ports & Sockets

An IP address identifies a **device** on a network, but a device can run many services at the same time (web server, SSH, database, etc.).  
To distinguish between them, we use **ports**.

---

### üî¢ What is a Port?
- A **port** is a 16-bit number (0‚Äì65535) that identifies a specific process or service running on a device.  
- **Well-known ports** (0‚Äì1023) are reserved for common services.  
- Examples:
  - **22** ‚Üí SSH  
  - **53** ‚Üí DNS  
  - **80** ‚Üí HTTP  
  - **443** ‚Üí HTTPS  
  - **3306** ‚Üí MySQL  

---

### üîå What is a Socket?
- A **socket** = **IP Address + Port Number**.  
- This uniquely identifies a connection.  
- Example:  
  - Client (your laptop): `192.168.1.5:50512`  
  - Server (GitHub): `140.82.xx.xx:443`  
  - Together, they form a socket pair that enables communication.  

---

### üåç Real-World Examples
#### 1. SSH into a Server

```bash
ssh ubuntu@34.120.xx.xx -p 22
```

* Your laptop uses a random port (e.g., `50512`) to connect to the server‚Äôs port `22`.

#### 2. Web Browsing

* Browser connects to `github.com:443` (HTTPS).
* Multiple tabs can open different sockets to the same server IP.

#### 3. Databases in DevOps

* Application connects to `db.internal.company:3306` (MySQL).
* Only the DB server listens on that port; firewall rules restrict access.

#### 4. Kubernetes Services

* A pod running NGINX might listen on port `80`.
* A Kubernetes Service maps it to a NodePort (e.g., `30080`) or LoadBalancer port.

### üîê Ephemeral Ports

* When your system initiates a connection, it picks a random high-numbered port (usually `49152‚Äì65535`).
* This is called an **ephemeral port**.
* That‚Äôs why you can open multiple browser tabs to the same website ‚Äî each uses a different ephemeral port.

### üß© Key Takeaways

- **IP** = device address
- **Port** = service address
- **Socket** = IP + Port uniquely identifies a connection
- Well-known ports are standardized for common protocols
- DevOps engineers must know ports when configuring firewalls, load balancers, and Kubernetes services

## 8. Networking Infrastructure

Networking infrastructure defines how devices are physically and logically connected. Depending on scale, we classify networks into different types.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Local Area Network (LAN)
- Covers a **small geographic area** (office, home, campus).  
- High speed (up to 1‚Äì10 Gbps commonly).  
- Usually built with **Ethernet (wired)** or **WiFi (wireless)**.  
- Example:  
  - Your office floor where all employee laptops, IP phones, and printers are connected to a central switch.  
  - Internal systems like Jenkins, GitLab runners, or a local database cluster may be accessible only via LAN.  

---

### üèôÔ∏è Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- Covers a **city or large campus**.  
- Connects multiple LANs together using fiber optics.  
- Example:  
  - A university with several departments connected via MAN.  
  - An ISP (Internet Service Provider) using MAN to connect data centers within a city.  

---

### üåç Wide Area Network (WAN)
- Covers a **large geographic area** (country or continent).  
- The **Internet itself is the largest WAN**.  
- Example:  
  - A company‚Äôs branch office in Bengaluru accessing databases hosted in AWS Mumbai region.  
  - VPN tunnels connecting corporate offices across the globe.  

---

### üì± Personal Area Network (PAN)
- Very small network (a few meters).  
- Example:  
  - Developer using Bluetooth tethering to connect laptop ‚Üî mobile hotspot.  
  - Wireless keyboard/mouse connected to a workstation.  

---

### üåê Submarine Cables (Optical Fiber Backbone)
- The Internet heavily depends on **undersea optical fiber cables**.  
- These cables transmit data between continents at **Tbps speed**.  
- Example in IT:  
  - When you open `github.com` in India, your request might travel through submarine cables to GitHub‚Äôs data centers in the US or Europe.  
- Without submarine cables, cloud services, SaaS products, and global communication would be impossible.  

---

### üß© Key Takeaways
- **LAN** = office/home networks.  
- **MAN** = city-wide networks.  
- **WAN** = country/continent-wide, the Internet itself.  
- **PAN** = personal small-scale connections.  
- **Submarine cables** are the backbone of global connectivity.  
- DevOps engineers rely on this layered infrastructure to connect CI/CD systems, cloud environments, and global services.  

---

## 9. Networking Devices

Networking devices are the physical and virtual components that make communication possible in IT environments. These devices forward, filter, and secure traffic between systems.

---

### üñß Switch
- Operates at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**.  
- Forwards traffic based on **MAC addresses**.  
- Connects multiple devices inside a **LAN**.  
- Example: An office floor where all laptops connect to a switch, which builds a MAC address table to forward frames efficiently.  

---

### üåê Router
- Operates at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**.  
- Forwards packets between different networks using **IP addresses**.  
- Example: Your office LAN is connected to the Internet via a router. The router ensures traffic from `192.168.1.x` (private IP) can reach the public Internet.  

---

### üì° Modem
- Converts **digital signals** (computer) ‚Üî **analog signals** (telephone/cable lines).  
- Example: Your ISP gives a modem that translates signals on coaxial/fiber lines into Ethernet that your router/switch can use.  

---

### üî• Firewall
- Monitors and controls **incoming/outgoing traffic** based on rules.  
- Can be hardware or software (e.g., iptables, AWS Security Groups).  
- Example: Blocking all traffic except ports 22 (SSH) and 443 (HTTPS) on a production server.  

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancer
- Distributes network traffic across multiple servers to ensure **high availability** and **scalability**.  
- Example:  
  - AWS Elastic Load Balancer distributing traffic across multiple EC2 instances running a web app.  
  - NGINX or HAProxy used in Kubernetes ingress to balance traffic between pods.  

---

### üì∂ Access Point (AP)
- Extends a wired LAN into a **wireless network (WiFi)**.  
- Example: Office WiFi AP allows laptops and mobile devices to join the LAN without Ethernet cables.  

---

### üß∞ Other Devices
- **Hub** ‚Äì A basic, outdated device that broadcasts packets to all connected devices (inefficient compared to a switch).  
- **Gateway** ‚Äì A device that translates between two different network protocols.  
- **Proxy Server** ‚Äì Acts as an intermediary between client and server for caching, filtering, or anonymity.  

---

### üß© Key Takeaways
- **Switch** = connects devices inside a LAN using MAC addresses.  
- **Router** = connects different networks using IP addresses.  
- **Modem** = converts analog ‚Üî digital signals for ISP connections.  
- **Firewall** = enforces security rules for network traffic.  
- **Load Balancer** = distributes requests across multiple servers.  
- **Access Point** = extends LAN to WiFi.
