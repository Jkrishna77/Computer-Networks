# 🌐 Computer Networks

## 1. Introduction to Computer Networks

A **computer network** is a system of interconnected devices (computers, servers, routers, switches, mobile devices, IoT sensors, etc.) that can exchange data and share resources with each other.  
In today’s IT world, networks form the backbone of almost everything we do — from browsing websites, deploying applications in the cloud, video conferencing, to managing distributed systems in DevOps.

### 🔑 Why Networks Matter in IT?
- **Collaboration:** Teams across the globe can work together in real-time (e.g., Google Docs, Slack).  
- **Cloud Computing:** AWS, Azure, and GCP rely entirely on networking to connect data centers and customers.  
- **Microservices & DevOps:** Modern applications are broken into multiple services (APIs, databases, caching layers) that communicate over the network.  
- **Remote Work:** VPNs, SSH, and secure protocols allow engineers to manage servers from anywhere.  

Without networks, there would be no **Internet**, no **email**, no **websites**, no **DevOps pipelines**, and no **distributed systems**.

### ⚙️ Real-World Example: Opening `https://github.com`
When you type `https://github.com` in your browser:
1. **DNS Resolution:** The domain name `github.com` is translated into an IP address.  
2. **TCP Connection:** Your browser establishes a **TCP connection** with GitHub’s server over port `443` (HTTPS).  
3. **TLS Handshake:** A secure encrypted channel is set up using TLS.  
4. **HTTP Request:** Your browser sends an HTTP `GET` request asking for the GitHub homepage.  
5. **Server Response:** GitHub’s servers respond with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.  
6. **Rendering:** Your browser renders the page and shows the GitHub homepage.  

All of this happens in **milliseconds**, powered by computer networks.

### 🧩 Key Takeaways
- A network connects devices so they can **communicate** and **share resources**.  
- Networking is essential for **software engineers, DevOps engineers, and cloud architects**.  
- Even simple actions like opening a website involve **multiple networking steps and protocols**.

## 2. History & Evolution of Networks

Computer networking has evolved rapidly over the past few decades. Let’s focus on the **key changes that shaped today’s Internet**:

---

### 📡 Early Days
- **1960s–70s:** ARPANET connected a few universities — the first step towards the Internet.  
- Networks were limited, used mainly for research and text-based communication.  

---

### 💻 Client-Server Era
- **1980s–90s:** Rise of **client-server model** — PCs connected to central servers for email, file sharing, and applications.  
- Protocols like **SMTP (email), FTP (file transfer), HTTP (web)** became popular.  
- Businesses began deploying **LANs (Local Area Networks)** in offices.  

---

### 🌍 Birth of the Internet
- **1990s:** Networks worldwide connected, forming the **Internet**.  
- Websites, web browsers, and ISPs became mainstream.  
- **Optical fiber cables** and undersea cables started forming the global backbone.  

---

### ☁️ Modern Networking
- **2000s–Present:**  
  - **Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, GCP):** On-demand servers and services accessible via the Internet.  
  - **Mobile & Wireless:** WiFi, 4G/5G networks enable always-on connectivity.  
  - **DevOps & Microservices:** Applications are distributed across multiple services communicating over APIs.  
  - **Virtual Networks:** VPNs, SDN (Software Defined Networking), and container networking (Kubernetes CNIs).  

---

### 🧩 Key Takeaways
- Networking moved from **research → business → Internet → cloud-native world**.  
- Today, almost all modern IT infrastructure — from Kubernetes clusters to CI/CD pipelines — relies on computer networks.
