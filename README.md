# üåê Computer Networks

## 1. Introduction to Computer Networks

A **computer network** is a system of interconnected devices (computers, servers, routers, switches, mobile devices, IoT sensors, etc.) that can exchange data and share resources with each other.  
In today‚Äôs IT world, networks form the backbone of almost everything we do ‚Äî from browsing websites, deploying applications in the cloud, video conferencing, to managing distributed systems in DevOps.

### üîë Why Networks Matter in IT?
- **Collaboration:** Teams across the globe can work together in real-time (e.g., Google Docs, Slack).  
- **Cloud Computing:** AWS, Azure, and GCP rely entirely on networking to connect data centers and customers.  
- **Microservices & DevOps:** Modern applications are broken into multiple services (APIs, databases, caching layers) that communicate over the network.  
- **Remote Work:** VPNs, SSH, and secure protocols allow engineers to manage servers from anywhere.  

Without networks, there would be no **Internet**, no **email**, no **websites**, no **DevOps pipelines**, and no **distributed systems**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Real-World Example: Opening `https://github.com`
When you type `https://github.com` in your browser:
1. **DNS Resolution:** The domain name `github.com` is translated into an IP address.  
2. **TCP Connection:** Your browser establishes a **TCP connection** with GitHub‚Äôs server over port `443` (HTTPS).  
3. **TLS Handshake:** A secure encrypted channel is set up using TLS.  
4. **HTTP Request:** Your browser sends an HTTP `GET` request asking for the GitHub homepage.  
5. **Server Response:** GitHub‚Äôs servers respond with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.  
6. **Rendering:** Your browser renders the page and shows the GitHub homepage.  

All of this happens in **milliseconds**, powered by computer networks.

### üß© Key Takeaways
- A network connects devices so they can **communicate** and **share resources**.  
- Networking is essential for **software engineers, DevOps engineers, and cloud architects**.  
- Even simple actions like opening a website involve **multiple networking steps and protocols**.
